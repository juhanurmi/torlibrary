TOR EXIT RELAYS, TOR BROWSERS AND VARIOUS PRIVACY TOOLS IN FINNISH LIBRARIES
============================================================================


Basic idea
-----------

Example to us: https://libraryfreedomproject.org/torexitpilotphase1/

"When a user opens the Tor Browser and navigates to a website, her traffic is bounced over three relays, scrambling her traffic with three layers of encryption, making her original IP address undetectable. The exit relay is the last relay in this circuit, the one that talks to the public internet. Fast, stable exit relays are vital to the strength of the Tor network. Non-exit relays – guards, middle relays, and bridges – are also important to the Tor network, but exit nodes are the most needed, and libraries can afford some of the legal exposure that comes with an exit. It’s not dangerous to run an exit, but because the exit node is the only identifiable one on the circuit, exit operators might face the occasional DMCA notice or law enforcement officer inquiring about traffic on the node. Since libraries already provide public internet services, we are protected by from DMCA takedowns by safe harbor provisions and are shielded from the threats that an individual exit relay operator might face in trying to explain to law enforcement that the traffic leaving her exit is not her own. For more on how the Tor network and Tor Browser work, check out this awesome animation from Tor Project."

First meeting with Finnish libraries: 11/11/2015

This is it: We have to sell the idea now.
It's a one time opportunity.
Listeners are the very heads of the Finnish libraries.
